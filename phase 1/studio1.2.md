Assignment Title:  Visual Prompt Studio Phase 1.2
Prompt: Create an artwork drawing using orange/brownish ink of the side profile of a head. The head should take up most of the room and the background should be an off-white color. I want it to be done using cross-hatching and there should be darker values by the jaw line, ears, cheekbone, and nose with highlights at the top of the nose and forehead.The beard should have directional lines to give it a sense of movement. The lines and shading should make it seem 3D though it is on paper.
